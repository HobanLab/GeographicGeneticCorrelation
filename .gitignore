# Folder of GIS files (for geographic/ecological analyses). Included in this folder are the .shp files used for 
# calculating geographic range for different species. These are two large (> 50MB) to be included on the repository.

# STRUCTURE input file for Pinus contorta dataset (PICO). This file is referenced in the Demo_PICO.R script, but is too large
# (> 50MB) to be included on the repository.

# Subset VCF file for Arabidopsis thaliana dataset (ARTH). This file is referenced in the Demo_ARTH.R script, but is too large
# (> 50 MB) to be included on the repository.

# Data inputs (both genetic and geographic) for Hibiscus waimeae. The genetic data cannot be shared on GitHub because
# the VCF size is greater than 50 MB. The geographic data cannot be shared because coordinates are protected (as this
# is a threatened, rare plant)
Datasets/HIWA/*

# Data inputs (both genetic and geographic) for Conradina glabra. The genetic data cannot be shared on GitHub because
# the VCF size is greater than 50 MB. The geographic data cannot be shared because coordinates are protected (as this
# is a threatened, rare plant)
Datasets/COGL/*

# Data inputs (both genetic and geographic) for Amsonia tharpii. The genetic data isn't shared on GitHub because
# analyses have not been published yet. The geographic data cannot be shared because coordinates are protected (as this
# is a threatened, rare plant)
